# eth-sweep
A simple web tool that allows you to sweep your wallet of ETH, erc20 & erc721 tokens. 

## Features 
* Send all your ETH
* Send all your ERC20 tokens 
* Send all your ERC721 tokens 

## Limitations 
* If you deposit tokens somewhere they will not be visible unless they themselves are tokenised e.g. cDAI
* Sending all your eth should be done after the tokens are sweeped as it is impossible to exactly calculate how much eth you will need in gas fees.
